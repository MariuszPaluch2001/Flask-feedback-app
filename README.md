I borrow idea for an application from here - https://pythonistaplanet.com/python-flask-project-ideas/

Aplication description:

You can create a web application using Python Flask, which can act as a feedback form for your company or any services that you offer. For example, if you’re a freelance web developer, you can use this feedback form to give to your clients or add to your website so that they can give you their opinion on your service. 

Continuous feedback from your clients will help you to improve your services and thereby land more clients. You can use a free service like mailtrap.io for your application to send emails. You’ll also need Postgres and pgAdmin. After creating the web application, you can deploy it to Heroku for free.

If you’re interested in doing this project, check out this tutorial from Brad Traversy, which will show you how to do a project like this.
